# League-of-Legends-Win-Predictor

This repository contains R code for a machine learning project predicting the win rate of a League of Legends game based on statistics at 10 minutes. 
The project tests 8 models: elastic net logistic regression, logisitic regression, k-nearest neighbors, ridge regression, lasso regression, linear discriminant analysis, random forest, and support vector machine. 

The data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min).
